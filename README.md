## Task: The Average Effect

A recent Toydarian study discovered that Ferengi are most likely to buy a product in an online shop, if the product's price is below the average product price of the shop. This effect also applies to all products of a category, so Ferengi are more likely to buy a product being cheaper than the average price in that product's category.

As a developer you want to empower your merchants to cash in on the *Average Effect*.

Using the [ePages API](https://developer.epages.com/) you should:

1. Compute the average price of all products in a shop
2. Compute the average price of all products in a certain category
3. List all products cheaper than the average product price (of the shop or for one category or for all categories)
